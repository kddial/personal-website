<h1>Using Flexbox Gap for uniform spacing</h1>

<p>
  Using <code>gap</code> inside <code>flexbox</code> is a simple
  solution to give you uniform spacing between elements. Previously I
  would use <code>margin</code> on all elements except for
  <code>first-child</code>
  and <code>last-child</code>, which was a clunky solution. The gap
  property was originally introduced for CSS Grids but it has been
  brought over for Flexbox support since 2021 (see sources).
